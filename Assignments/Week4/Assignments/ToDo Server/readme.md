# ToDo List Application

This project is a simple ToDo list application built with Node.js and Express. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks, with data stored in a JSON file for persistence.

## Features

- **Create a ToDo**: Users can add a new task with a title and description.
- **Read ToDos**: Retrieve all tasks or a specific task by ID.
- **Update a ToDo**: Modify an existing task by its ID.
- **Delete a ToDo**: Remove a task by its ID.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a JSON file, ensuring that data remains intact even after the server restarts.

## API Endpoints

1. **GET /todos**
   - Retrieves a list of all ToDo items.
   - **Response:** `200 OK` with an array of ToDo items in JSON format.
   - **Example:** `GET http://localhost:4000/todos`

2. **GET /todos/:id**
   - Retrieves a specific ToDo item by ID.
   - **Response:** `200 OK` with the ToDo item in JSON format if found, or `404 Not Found` if not found.
   - **Example:** `GET http://localhost:4000/todos/123`

3. **POST /todos**
   - Creates a new ToDo item.
   - **Request Body:** JSON object representing the ToDo item.
   - **Response:** `201 Created` with the ID of the created ToDo item in JSON format.
   - **Example:** 
     ```
     POST http://localhost:4000/todos
     Request Body: { "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": false, "description": "I should buy groceries" }
     ```

4. **PUT /todos/:id**
   - Updates an existing ToDo item by ID.
   - **Request Body:** JSON object representing the updated ToDo item.
   - **Response:** `200 OK` if the ToDo item was found and updated, or `404 Not Found` if not found.
   - **Example:** 
     ```
     PUT http://localhost:4000/todos/123
     Request Body: { "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": true }
     ```

5. **DELETE /todos/:id**
   - Deletes a ToDo item by ID.
   - **Response:** `200 OK` if the ToDo item was found and deleted, or `404 Not Found` if not found.
   - **Example:** `DELETE http://localhost:4000/todos/123`

6. **Wildcard Route**
   - For any other route not defined in the server, a `404 Not Found` response is returned.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
4. The server will run on `http://localhost:4000`.

## Testing

To test the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test-todoServer
```

If you encounter an error stating that port 3000 is in use, you can change the port in the `app.listen` method to another available port, like `4000`.
