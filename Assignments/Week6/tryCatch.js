// Try and Catch Block
// whenever an error occurs in interpreting lets say line 7, the execuion will stop there ,process exit and the subsequent 
// statements will never be excuted, now i we don't want program to stop excuting we wil simply wrap the code throwing
// exceptions inside try block, this will make sure not to stop program execution

try{

}
catch(err){//if err is caught control will reach here right next after the line whic throwed the err, if no error is caught control will never reach here

}
